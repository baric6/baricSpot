The Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) is a community-driven effort to combine descriptive information about vulnerabilities (CVEs) with evidence of actual exploitation in-the-wild. By collecting and analyzing these data, EPSS seeks to improve vulnerability prioritization by estimating the likelihood that a vulnerability will be exploited. The EPSS model produces a probability score between 0 and 1 (0% and 100%). The higher the score, the greater the probability that a vulnerability will be exploited (in the next 30 days).
