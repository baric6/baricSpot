# What is IAM (Identity and access management)

An IAM framework enables IT to control user access to critical information within their organizations. IAM products offer role-based access control, which lets system administrators regulate access to systems or networks based on the roles of individual users within the enterprise.

Identity and access management (IAM or IdAM) is a framework containing the tools and policies a company uses to verify a user’s identity, authorize controlled access to company resources, and audit user and device access across their IT infrastructure.‍

* An IAM system should also allow administrators to instantly view and change evolving access roles and rights
* a framework of policies and technologies to ensure that the right users have the appropriate access to technology resources
* Many companies limit access to physical offices by requiring security personnel to check employee ID badges or authorize guest access. These companies may also limit what rooms and locations employees or guests are permitted to enter with their IDs. In the world of cybersecurity, IAM represents the digital equivalent of these security procedures.
