# Artists Against 419 spam

The Internet is great, isn't it? It's a magical place, where you can buy anything you want, meet new people, find information... and lose all your money to scammers.

We've never liked that last part, so we started to fight back. Over time our art has evolved, and we now maintain the largest manually researched online repository of web sites used in internet fraud.

We offer a complete public interface for our site visitors, as well as database access through web services which can be used for automated retrieval of fake site entries. Web browser toolbars use our database feed to warn users that a site they visit is a fake company run by scammers. But most importantly, we continue to build better relations with other anti-fraud organizations and web hosting companies, to pursue our goal of ridding the Internet of fraudulent web sites.
