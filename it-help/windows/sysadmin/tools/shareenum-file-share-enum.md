An aspect of Windows NT/2000/XP network security that's often overlooked is file shares. A common security flaw occurs when users define file shares with lax security, allowing unauthorized users to see sensitive files. There are no built-in tools to list shares viewable on a network and their security settings, but ShareEnum fills the void and allows you to lock down file shares in your network.
