# Types of records

The DNS server stores entries for hostnames, IP addresses, and other information as resource records.  Each record type has a specific use. The following table lists common resource records.

| Record Type              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SOA (Start of Authority) | <p>The first record in any DNS database file is the SOA. The SOA record:</p><ul><li>Defines the general parameters for the DNS zone.</li><li>Is assigned to the DNS server hosting the primary copy of a zone.</li><li>Is the first record in the zone database file. There is only one SOA record in each database.</li><li>Includes parameters such as the authoritative server and the zone file serial number.</li><li>Includes an email address for the administrator responsible for the DNS domain.</li></ul> |
| NS (Name Server)         | The NS resource record identifies all DNS servers that can perform name resolution for the zone. Typically, there is an entry for the primary server and all secondary servers for the zone (all authoritative DNS servers).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| A (Host Address)         | A records map DNS host names to IPv4 (32-bit) addresses. This is the most common resource record type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| AAAA (Quad-A)            | AAAA records map DNS host names to IPv6 (128-bit) addresses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| PTR (Pointer)            | <p>In a reverse lookup zone, the PTR records map IP addresses to a DNS hostname by pointing to the appropriate A or AAAA records.</p><ul><li>IPv4 PTR records are created in the in-addr.arpa namespace.</li><li>IPv6 addresses are created in the ip6.arpa namespace.</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| CNAME (Canonical Name)   | <p>CNAME records provide alternate names (or aliases) for hosts that already have an host (A or AAAA) record. CNAME records enable servers to be referred to by different names in DNS. These records are useful when:</p><ul><li>Migrating servers.</li><li>Giving a user friendly-name to a server that has a complex name.</li><li>Redirecting traffic to an ISP hosting a web site.</li></ul>                                                                                                                    |
| MX (Mail Exchanger)      | MX records identify servers that are available to receive Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) mail. MX records are configured with a priority. A lower priority indicates a preferred server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| SRV (Service Locator)    | SRV records are used to indicate the resources that perform a particular service. This allows clients to find services (such as domain controllers) through DNS. Windows automatically creates these records as needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Active Directory         | <p>Active Directory records are kept in an _msdcs.domain zone (for example, _msdcs.CorpNet.com).</p><ul><li>Most Active Directory records are SRV records that identify services provided by Active Directory.</li><li>Clients use Active Directory SRV records to locate domain resources, like domain controllers and global catalog servers.</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                            |
