**ntfy** (pronounced "_notify_") is a simple HTTP-based [pub-sub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) notification service. With ntfy, you can **send notifications to your phone or desktop via scripts** from any computer, **without having to sign up or pay any fees**. If you'd like to run your own instance of the service, you can easily do so since ntfy is open source.
