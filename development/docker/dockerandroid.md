# DockerAndroid

## Run Android in Docker with NoVNC and Video Recording

This project provides Docker images for different Android versions (API 28–34) and device profiles (Samsung Galaxy S10, Nexus devices, etc.). It’s not just an emulator—it’s a full containerized Android environment with:

* **noVNC support**: View and interact with the emulator via a browser.
* **ADB control**: Connect to the emulator from outside the container.
* **Video recording**: Capture test sessions for debugging.
* **Cloud integration**: Works with Genymotion Cloud and other services.
