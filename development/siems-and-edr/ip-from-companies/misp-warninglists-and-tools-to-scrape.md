# misp-warninglists and tools to scrape

The warning lists are integrated in MISP to display an info/warning box at the event and attribute level if such indicators are available in one of the list. The lists are also used to filter potential false-positive at API level. The list can be globally enabled or disabled in MISP following the practices of the organization. The warning lists are reused in many other open source projects.
