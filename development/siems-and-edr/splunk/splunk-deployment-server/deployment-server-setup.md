# Deployment Server Setup

1. The Deployment server does not connect to the indexer or any other server. Just for forwarder management
2. It is made to just push .conf, so when you install the a universal forwarder point it to the deployment server address and the server will push a .conf to the agent witch will connect to the Indexer
