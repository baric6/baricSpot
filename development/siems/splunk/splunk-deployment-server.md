# Splunk Deployment Server

_noun_

A Splunk Enterprise instance that acts as a centralized configuration manager, grouping together and collectively managing any number of Splunk Enterprise instances. Instances that are remotely configured by deployment servers are called [deployment clients](https://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:Deploymentclient). The deployment server downloads updated content, such as configuration files and apps, to deployment clients. Units of such content are known as [deployment apps](https://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:Deploymentapp).

The [forwarder management](https://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:Forwardermanagement) interface offers an easy way to configure the deployment server.
