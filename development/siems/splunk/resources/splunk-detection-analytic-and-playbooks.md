# Splunk Detection, Analytic and playbooks

This project gives you access to our repository of Analytic Stories that are security guides which provide background on TTPs, mapped to the MITRE framework, the Lockheed Martin Kill Chain, and CIS controls. They include Splunk searches, machine-learning algorithms, and Splunk SOAR playbooks (where available)—all designed to work together to detect, investigate, and respond to threats.
