# Powershell Gallery

The PowerShell Gallery is the central repository for PowerShell content. In it, you can find PowerShell scripts, modules containing PowerShell cmdlets and Desired State Configuration (DSC) resources. Some of these packages are authored by Microsoft, and others are authored by the PowerShell community.

The PowerShellGet module contains cmdlets for discovering, installing, updating, and publishing PowerShell packages from the PowerShell Gallery. These packages can contain artifacts such as Modules, DSC Resources, Role Capabilities, and Scripts. Make sure you have the latest version of PowerShellGet installed.
