# Telegram-API: a Python-based open-source tool for Telegram

This tool connects to Telegram's API. It generates JSON files containing channel's data, including channel's information and posts. You can search for a specific channel, or a set of channels provided in a text file (one channel per line.)

Files are saved by default in a folder called output/data. These folders are created by the script. You can also give a specific output directory to store collected data.
