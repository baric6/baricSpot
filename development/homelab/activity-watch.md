# Activity Watch

The goal of ActivityWatch is simple: _Enable the collection of as much valuable lifedata as possible without compromising user privacy._

We've worked towards this goal by creating an application for safe storage of the data on the user's local machine and as well as a set of watchers which record data such as:

* Currently active application and the title of its window
* Currently active browser tab and its title and URL
* Keyboard and mouse activity, to detect if you are AFK ("away from keyboard") or not

It is up to you as user to collect as much as you want, or as little as you want (and we hope some of you will help write watchers so we can collect more).
