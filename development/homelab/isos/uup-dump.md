# UUP dump

The UUP dump project allows users to create ISO files for Windows 11 (Canary, Dev, Beta, and Release Preview Insider channels, as well as production releases such as 22H2/22621.x and 21H2/22000.x), Windows 10 (22H2/19045.x, 21H2/19044.x, and 1809/17763.x) and Windows Server (22H2/20349.x and 21H2/20348.x). If you want to create Arm64 Windows ISOs for testing, you can do that as well. The cherry on top is that it can build multi-edition Windows images for consumer SKUs, and even output slipstreamed up-to-date ISOs, depending on the host OS.
