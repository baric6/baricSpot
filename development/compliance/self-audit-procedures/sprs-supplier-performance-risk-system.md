# (SPRS) Supplier Performance Risk System

What is a SPRS?\
Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS) “...is the authoritative source to retrieve supplier and product PI \[performance information] assessments for the DoD \[Department of Defense] acquisition community to use in identifying, assessing, and monitoring unclassified performance.” (DoDI 5000.79)

**Score**

Every company begins at 110 points.

The full point range is -203 to a perfect score of 110. One thing to note regarding medium and high assessments; the max score for a virtual assessment is reduced from 110 to 100. This is because the DoD cannot independently verify the physical controls.
