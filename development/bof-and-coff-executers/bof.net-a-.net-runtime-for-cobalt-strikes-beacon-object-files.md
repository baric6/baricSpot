# BOF.NET - A .NET Runtime for Cobalt Strike's Beacon Object Files

BOF.NET is a small native BOF object combined with the BOF.NET managed runtime that enables the development of Cobalt Strike BOFs directly in .NET. BOF.NET removes the complexity of native compilation along with the headaches of manually importing native API. Testing BOF.NET assemblies is also generally much easier, since the .NET assemblies can be debugged using a traditional managed debugger.
