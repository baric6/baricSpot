# KQL Hunting-Queries-Detection-Rules

The purpose of this repository is to share KQL queries that can be used by anyone and are understandable. These queries are intended to increase detection coverage through the logs of Microsoft Security products. Not all suspicious activities generate an alert by default, but many of those activities can be made detectable through the logs. These queries include Detection Rules, Hunting Queries and Visualizations
