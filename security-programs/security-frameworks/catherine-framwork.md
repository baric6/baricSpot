The Catherine Framework is a general-purpose cybersecurity framework built to aggregate, validate, decode, decrypt, and maintain data. Catherine currently collects information from dumping hexadecimal content from files, validates malicious domains & IP addresses, attempts to crack unknown hashes, handles real-time database analysis, various types of decoding, and much more. Thanks to Catherine being built in an easily packaged executable, you can quickly download the tool by running cargo install catherine via the Cargo ecosystem. Catherine can also be quickly compiled by pulling down the source code from git and simply running cargo build.

Catherine provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI) built into the executable. This means whether you install from source or Cargo, you can choose your method of use.
