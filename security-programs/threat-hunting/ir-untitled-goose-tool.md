# (IR) Untitled Goose tool

Untitled Goose Tool is a robust and flexible hunt and incident response tool that adds novel authentication and data gathering methods in order to run a full investigation against a customer’s Azure Active Directory (AzureAD), Azure, and M365 environments. Untitled Goose Tool gathers additional telemetry from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) and Defender for Internet of Things (IoT) (D4IoT).

This tool was designed to assist incident response teams by exporting cloud artifacts after an incident for environments that aren't ingesting logs into a Security Information and Events Management (SIEM) or other long term solution for logs.
