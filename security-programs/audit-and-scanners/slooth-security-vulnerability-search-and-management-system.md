# Slooth Security Vulnerability Search and Management System

Slooth is an advanced vulnerability management system designed to help organizations stay ahead of security threats. By leveraging the Python NVD API wrapper and a REST API, Slooth fetches and organizes data about Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). It provides a unique identifier, the CVE ID, for stakeholders to discuss and research specific vulnerabilities.
