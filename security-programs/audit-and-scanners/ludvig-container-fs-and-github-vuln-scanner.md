# Ludvig container,FS and github vuln scanner

Named after Kjell Aukrust's character Ludvig who thinks everything is dangerous and is scared of the dark during the day.

Why yet another scanner?

Mostly because I thought it was a fun way to use YARA rules for something in addition to malware hunting and to learn how these kind of tools are made.

Anyway! Ludvig can, by means of Yara, detect secrets and what-nots in binaries as well as text files. Is it not that we are most worried about? Our secrets leaking into our artifacts that are pushed onto the world?
