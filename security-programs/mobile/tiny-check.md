TinyCheck allows you to easily capture network communications from a smartphone or any device which can be associated to a Wi-Fi access point in order to quickly analyze them. This can be used to check if any suspect or malicious communication is outgoing from a smartphone, by using heuristics or specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).

The idea of TinyCheck emerged in a meeting about stalkerware with a French women's shelter. During this meeting we talked about how to easily detect stalkerware without installing very technical apps nor doing forensic analysis on the victim's smartphone. The initial concept was to develop a tiny kiosk device based on Raspberry Pi which can be used by non-tech people to test their smartphones against malicious communications issued by stalkerware or any spyware.

Of course, TinyCheck can also be used to spot any malicious communications from cybercrime to state-sponsored implants. It allows the end-user to push their own extended Indicators of Compromise via a backend in order to detect some ghosts over the wire.
