# WebPalm

WebPalm is a command-line tool that enables users to traverse a website and generate a tree of all its webpages and their links. It uses a recursive approach to enter each link found on a webpage and continues to do so until all levels have been explored. In addition to generating a site map, WebPalm can extract data from the body of each page using regular expressions and save the results in a file. This feature can be useful for web scraping or extracting specific information.
