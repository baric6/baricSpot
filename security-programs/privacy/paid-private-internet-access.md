# (Paid) Private Internet Access

When you go online with a VPN, all your inbound and outbound traffic travels through an encrypted tunnel. This means ISPs, cyber-criminals, network admins, and anyone else who might be snooping on your activity won’t be able to see what you’re up to.

A VPN routes your traffic through a remote server instead of sending it straight to the site you’re trying to reach. This masks your real IP address with one of its own, hiding it from prying eyes. That way, none of your activity can be linked back to your real IP address.

A VPN can also make it seem like you’re somewhere else. If you’re in the UK, for instance, you can connect to a VPN server in the US to get a US IP address. The more servers and country locations your VPN provider has, the more options you have.
