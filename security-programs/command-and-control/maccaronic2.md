# MaccaroniC2

MaccaroniC2 is a proof-of-concept Command and Control framework that utilizes the powerful AsyncSSH Python library which provides an asynchronous client and server implementation of the SSHv2 protocol and use PyNgrok wrapper for ngrok integration. This tool is inspired for a specific scenario where the victim runs the AsyncSSH server and establishes a tunnel to the outside, ready to receive commands by the attacker.
