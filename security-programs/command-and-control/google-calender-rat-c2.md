# Google calender Rat (C2)

Google Calendar RAT is a PoC of Command\&Control (C2) over Google Calendar Events, This tool has been developed for those circumstances where it is difficult to create an entire red teaming infrastructure. To use GRC, only a Gmail account is required. The script creates a 'Covert Channel' by exploiting the event descriptions in Google Calendar. The target will connect directly to Google." It could be considered as a layer 7 application Covert Channel (but some friends would say it cannot be :) very thanks to my mates "Tortellini"&#x20;
