# Periscope C2

Note: This is a responsibly disclosed public version of a privately developed, complex, and fairly comprehensive offensive security C2 (command and control) toolset with its own phishing engine and remnants of a fully automated CI/CD deployment methodology. It is intentionally published in such a way that it may be used for educational purposes but will require considerable engineering expertise to make it fully functional.

For example, the agent projects are published incompletely and will not result in ready to use malware.
