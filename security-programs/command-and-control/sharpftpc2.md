SharpFtpC2 is a small, experimental project aimed at exploring the possibility of using FTP(S) for relaying commands and responses between two remote computers. It employs the FTP protocol as a makeshift tunnel through which the computers, both acting as clients connected to an FTP server, can communicate. A simple session management scheme is used to keep track of the exchange of requests and responses.
