# Octopus C2 Server

Octopus is an open source, pre-operation C2 server based on python which can control an Octopus powershell agent through HTTP/S.

The main purpose of creating Octopus is for use before any red team operation, where rather than starting the engagement with your full operational arsenal and infrastructure, you can use Octopus first to attack the target and gather information before you start your actual red team operation.
