Status

* emp3r0r C2 (Linux/Windows) is ready for testing. Please report bugs if you find any.
* Read wiki to get started
* Download from here
* Write modules for emp3r0r with your favorite languages
* Windows support is ready with fully-interactive shell Initially, emp3r0r was developed as one of my weaponizing experiments. It was a learning process for me trying to implement common Linux adversary techniques and some of my original ideas.

So, what makes emp3r0r different? First of all, it is the first C2 framework that targets Linux platform including the capability of using any other tools through it. Take a look at the features for more valid reasons to use it.

In fact, emp3r0r has complete python3.9 support, which is less than 7MB with necessary third party packages such as Requests or MySQL.
