# Nemo post-exploitation framework

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Nemo is yet another post-exploitation framework, focused around collaboration. Collaboration among multiple operators is managed by a "swarm", which can be remotely managed from the command and control. Payloads are not dynamically generated; nemo is not intended to be used in production. Do keep in mind that I'm fairly new to malware dev, and this is just one of those shower thought projects that magically came to life.
