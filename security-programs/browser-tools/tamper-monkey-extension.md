For example, with Tampermonkey, you could add a new button to a web page that lets you quickly share a link on social media, or to automatically fill in a form with your personal information. This is especially useful in the age of digitization, where web pages are often used as user interfaces for accessing a wide range of services and applications.

Whether you're a web developer looking to add new features to your site, or just a regular user looking to improve your online experience, Tampermonkey is a great tool to have in your toolkit.
