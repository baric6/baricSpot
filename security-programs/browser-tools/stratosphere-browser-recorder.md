# Stratosphere Browser Recorder

stratosphere is a free and open source OSINT platform that automatically collects every page you visit, building a private knowledge base you can analyze with Jupyter notebooks and an extensible suite of web apps including:

* LinkedIn contacts and companies explorer: Explore previously browsed LinkedIn profiles and companies
* Google search results: Review your past Google search results
* vk.com contacts explorer: Explore previously seen vk.com contacts, highlighting their connections
* Flows overview: Overview of web traffic intercepted in the last 10 minutes

You can also use the platform to quickly reverse-engineer HTTP/HTTPS web requests, including REST APIs. This lets you unlock the potential of private REST APIs, investigate GDPR breaches, and implement new scrapers to extend the knowledge base and power new web apps.
