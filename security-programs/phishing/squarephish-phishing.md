# Squarephish phishing

SquarePhish is an advanced phishing tool that uses a technique combining the OAuth Device code authentication flow and QR codes. An attacker can use the email module of SquarePhish to send a malicious QR code email to a victim. The default pretext is that the victim is required to update their Microsoft MFA authentication to continue using mobile email. The current client ID in use is the Microsoft Authenticator App.
