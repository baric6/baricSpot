# Evil Qr

Toolkit demonstrating another approach of a QRLJacking attack, allowing to perform remote account takeover, through sign-in QR code phishing.

It consists of a browser extension used by the attacker to extract the sign-in QR code and a server application, which retrieves the sign-in QR codes to display them on the hosted phishing pages.
