<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (441).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**WPProbe** is a **fast and efficient WordPress plugin scanner** that leverages **REST API enumeration (`?rest_route`)** to detect installed plugins **without brute-force**.

Unlike traditional scanners that hammer websites with requests, WPProbe takes a smarter approach by querying the exposed REST API. This technique allows us to **identify plugins stealthily**, reducing detection risks and **speeding up the scan process**.
