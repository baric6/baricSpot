# BugTrace-AI (needs AI key)

BugTrace-AI is a comprehensive web vulnerability analysis suite that leverages the power of Generative AI to assist developers, penetration testers, and security analysts. It provides a rich set of tools for both static (SAST) and dynamic (DAST) analysis, vulnerability research, and payload generation, all within a single, intuitive interface.

The core philosophy of BugTrace-AI is to act as an intelligent assistant, performing non-invasive reconnaissance and analysis to form high-quality hypotheses about potential vulnerabilities, which serve as a starting point for manual investigation.
