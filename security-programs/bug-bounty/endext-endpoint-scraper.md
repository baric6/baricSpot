# Endext endpoint scraper

When you crawll all the JS files from waybackruls for example, or even collecting the JS files urls from your target website's home source page .. If the website was using API system and you wanna look for all the endpoints in the JS files, cuz u may find something hidden here or there .. That's why i made this tool .. I give it the JS files urls .. It graps all the possible endpoints or urls or paths in the submitted JS files for me ..
