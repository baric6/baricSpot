# AutoRun

This utility, which has the most comprehensive knowledge of auto-starting locations of any startup monitor, shows you what programs are configured to run during system bootup or login, and when you start various built-in Windows applications like Internet Explorer, Explorer and media players. These programs and drivers include ones in your startup folder, Run, RunOnce, and other Registry keys. _Autoruns_ reports Explorer shell extensions, toolbars, browser helper objects, Winlogon notifications, auto-start services, and much more. _Autoruns_ goes way beyond other autostart utilities.
