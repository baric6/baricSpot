&#x20;N.B. You need to download the TrID/32 package (witch contains over 1.600 filetypes defs) to use this tool.

TrIDNet is an utility designed to identify file types from their binary signatures. While there are similar utilities with hard coded rules, TriID has no such rules. Instead, it is extensible and can be trained to recognize new formats in a fast and automatic way.
