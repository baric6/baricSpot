# Powersharppack

Many useful offensive CSharp Projects wraped into Powershell for easy usage.

Why? In my personal opinion offensive Powershell is not dead because of AMSI, Script-block-logging, Constrained Language Mode or other protection features. Any of these mechanisms can be bypassed. Since most new innovative offensive security projects are written in C# I decided to make them usable in powershell as well.
