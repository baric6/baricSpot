# WinPWN

Many past internal penetration tests I often had problems with the existing Powershell Recon / Exploitation scripts due to missing proxy support. I also often ran the same scripts one after the other to get information about the current system and/or the domain. To automate as many internal penetrationtest processes (reconnaissance as well as exploitation) and for the proxy reason I wrote my own script with automatic proxy recognition and integration. The script is mostly based on well-known large other offensive security Powershell projects.&#x20;
