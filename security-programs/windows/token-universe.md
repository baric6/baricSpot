&#x20;Token Universe is an advanced tool for experimenting and researching Windows security mechanisms. It exposes UI for creating, viewing, impersonating, and modifying access tokens, spawning processes, managing Local Security Authority, checking available access to many types of objects, and more. The program can operate and (at least partially) provide valuable functionality under a wide range of privileges, from LPAC AppContainer sandbox to SYSTEM with SeTcbPrivilege and SeCreateTokenPrivilege.
