# SharpBruteForceSSh

This is a simple SSH brute force tool written in C#. It is designed to perform dictionary-based brute force attacks on SSH services. The tool takes a target IP address, a list of usernames, and a list of passwords as input. It then attempts to authenticate using each combination of username and password until a successful login is found or all combinations have been exhausted.
