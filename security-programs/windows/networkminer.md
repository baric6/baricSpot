NetworkMiner is an [open source](https://www.netresec.com/?page=NetworkMinerSourceCode) network forensics tool that extracts artifacts, such as files, images, emails and passwords, from captured network traffic in PCAP files. NetworkMiner can also be used to capture live network traffic by sniffing a network interface.
