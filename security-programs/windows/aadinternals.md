# AADinternals

**AAD Internals** is a PowerShell module where I’ve tried to put all the knowledge I’ve gained during the years spent with Office 365 and Azure AD. It is a result of hours of reverse-engineering and debugging of Microsoft tools related to Azure AD, such as PowerShell modules, directory synchronisation, and admin portals.

The module is a **plain PowerShell script module**, so you can copy and paste the code to your own scripts as needed. Having said that, the are some functions that are utilising the built-in functionality of Windows. Thus, everything might not work on every computer.
