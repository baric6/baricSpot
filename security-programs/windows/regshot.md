# RegShot

```
Regshot is a small, free and open-source registry compare utility that allows you to quickly
take a snapshot of your registry and then compare it with a second one - done after doing
system changes or installing a new software product. The changes report can be produced in
text or HTML format and contains a list of all modifications that have taken place between
the two snapshots. In addition, you can also specify folders (with subfolders) to be
scanned for changes as well.
