YaraDbg is a free web-based Yara debugger to help security analysts to write hunting or detection rules with less effort and more confidence. By using YaraDbg, you can perform a thorough root-cause-analysis (RCA) on why some of your Yara rules did or did not match with a specific file. It can also help you to better maintain a large set of yara rules.
