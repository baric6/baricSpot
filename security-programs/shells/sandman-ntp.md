# Sandman NTP

Sandman is a backdoor that is meant to work on hardened networks during red team engagements.

Sandman works as a stager and leverages NTP (a protocol to sync time & date) to get and run an arbitrary shellcode from a pre-defined server.

Since NTP is a protocol that is overlooked by many defenders resulting in wide network accessibility.
